- After selecting the desired users, we click on **Send Email** button. On the next screen, we can compose our email. While sending bulk mails, you might want to change the name depending on the user, which can be done using {{Name}}. The same is done in the screenshot. Similarly, we can also include the occupation of the receiver.
